🤖 [trinityVR, HackMIT'23](https://github.com/NinaLong2077/trinityVR) In 36 hours, we played around with Oculus Headset, LangChain, ChatGPT, ElevenLab and turned characters from Silicon Velley into interactive agents in VR.

👾 **First Place, 2023 Nike INSIDIOUS Cybersecurity Hackathon** Catch the Flag style hackathon, I had a lot of fun solving encrypted messages and getting admin password through social engineering on Facebook (be careful with the info you put online).
